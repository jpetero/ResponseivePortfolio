          <p>
            I am Julius Peter Oketayot. I graduated from Kyambogo University
            Kampala with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering. Later I
            got a job as a Production Manager at Peacock Paints Limited in
            Kampala (Oct - 2018) but since then I had a deep love of becoming a
            software developer and I was looking for any available to join the
            software industry 100%
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked for opportunity around but Kampala and also online but I
            could not even find because the companies need people with enough
            skills and from computer related background. Not untill then when my
            luck came my way and I was admitted at Refactory Uganda (Industry's
            blueprint for hiring developers) for a short course which got me
            into the 6 months bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to quit my job at the Paints Factory and took the opportunity
            seriously to become a senior software developer. Currently I have
            developed my skills a lot Which I would love to share with you
            below;
